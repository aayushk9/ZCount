# ZCount: Track & Fix Your Sleep Debt   

##  Overview  
ZCount is a simple yet effective **sleep debt tracker** that helps users analyze their sleep patterns. Enter your **daily sleep hours** for a minimum of 4 days and ZCount will calculate:  
- Your **ideal sleep hours**  
- The **gap** between your actual sleep and the **rest you need**  

## Tech Stack  
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Vanilla JS, DOM Manipulation)  
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express  
- **Database**: MongoDB  

## How It Works  
Let's say you enter your sleep hours for **5 days**:  

```txt
Days = 5  
Sleeping Hours = 4, 3, 5, 6, 5 
```
ZCount will show you how much sleep you need to recover.
